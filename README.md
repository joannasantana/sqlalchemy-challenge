# SQLAlchemy Challenge
Prompt:

Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. You’ll use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, you’ll use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Skills Demonstrated:

- Use SQLAlchemy to:
    - Connect to a SQLite database.
    - Reflect database tables into Python classes.
    - Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.
    - Query the database to find weather data and filter by the most recent year of data and the busiest weather station.
- Use Python to:
    - Load query results into Pandas DataFrames.
    - Create summary statistics using Pandas.
    - Create data visualizations using Matplotlib.
    - Design a Flask application containing both static and dynamic routes based on the queries previously developed.
